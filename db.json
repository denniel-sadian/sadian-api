He is 16 and proud of being one of the Filipino programmers in the Philippines. He is in 11th grade and currently studying Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at Educational Systems Technological Institute in Boac, Marinduque, Philippines. He likes to program because it is his passion. He wants to create programs that can help and give happiness to people. According to him, computer programming is fun for those who love it, sometimes tiring, but very rewarding when performed very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first discovered that he likes to be a programmer when he was in 7th grade. In that time, his teacher in the computer had introduced them the viruses of all times, and he got amazed with the \"I love you\" virus that was said to have originated in the Philippines. He became interested in computers and began searching things on the internet about computers, and so the different computer languages were introduced to him. He mainly codes in Python programming language, almost all of his projects were written in Python. He also knows Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, C++, and C#. He is a web designer and a web developer at the same time. He also knows web scraping and a little bit of game development using C#, Unity3D technologies, Python and PyGame. He has a various knowledge of different modules and libraries in Python, some of them are Django, Selenium, PyGame, OpenPyxl, PyAutoGUI, Tkinter, PyTTSx3, ChatterBot, WebBrowser, Requests, BeautifulSoup, PyPDF2, CSV, JSON, Threading, SubProcess and much more. He also has knowledge of working with JQuery and AngularJS for front-end programming, W3.CSS, and Bootstrap for web designing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denniel Luis believes that everyone can learn how to program, they just have to keep their laziness and they will be on their way towards programming. A great programming experience, of course, starts from small. He suggests to take small projects first, proceed to do bigger ones when you feel that you can handle them already. He also believes that a great programming skill takes a very long time of practice and studying, there is no shortcut for this, if there is, then it will be filled with guesses, questions, and mostly errors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>\"If there is a will, there will be always a way\" </i></p>\r\n\r\n</div>"}}, {"model": "personal.day", "pk": 1, "fields": {"day": "Monday", "quote": "I try to create sympathy for my characters, then turn the monsters loose.", "whose": "Stephen King"}}, {"model": "personal.day", "pk": 2, "fields": {"day": "Tuesday", "quote": "The prose is architecture, not interior decoration.", "whose": "Ernest Hemingway"}}, {"model": "personal.day", "pk": 3, "fields": {"day": "Wednesday", "quote": "It\u2019s none of their business that you have to learn to write.

It may, and it may not. Others say that nothing is easy, but they do not say that all is hard. Programming is hard if you will think that it is hard, and the same thing if you will think of it as not. There are steps in learning programming. Those steps can make your learning easy. But those steps may vary on what you want in programming because it has different fields, just like in the world of medicine, doctors have their specialized areas. But in programming, you can enter all those fields if you want to. Anyway, we are not getting closer to our question. By the way, once again, the answer to our question above all depends on you. \u201cHow about you, what\u2019s your answer?\u201d \u2013 I like that question of yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, programming is way too hard! When I was learning HTML, I was like, \u201cYo! This is so easy!\u201d and I continue reading, then suddenly, I got punched in the face (not literally) that HTML won\u2019t give you a lot if you are not going to learn JavaScript, CSS (just a styling language) and much more languages that will ready you up with all skills you need in web development. By the way, the very first field that I got myself into with was this, web development. I learned HTML, CSS and JS in <a href=\"https://w3schools.com\" target=\"blank\" class=\"w3-text-green w3-hover-text-light-green\">W3Schools</a>. Such a nice website, it is. I thought myself as stupid that time by the way because I was getting myself into web development without having a consistent internet connection. I\u2019m not yet able to get my very own stable internet connection that time, and that made me said these words, \u201cBoy, learning programming is hard\u201d. Why did I say those words? Well, I get all of my stuff from the internet and If I don\u2019t have money for me to go in an internet caf\u00e9, learning programming will be paused for a while, until I have my own money again and I\u2019ll quickly go to the nearest internet caf\u00e9, not playing games but downloading tons of PDFs and other programs for learning. If you\u2019re like me, I feel you so much. Good thing that some knowledge in web development can be earned by just studying offline, but it\u2019s much better if you have an internet connection. That was one of my greatest hindrances in learning programming. Also, when I was learning JS, I was like, \u201cThis is so easy\u201d, read and read again, and do some small kinds of stuff by my own, then suddenly, \u201cWait, I can no longer remember the topics, I\u2019ll grab the learning resources again.\u201d Tutorials nowadays have their panels where steps in learning are organized, following that helps a lot. Skipping lessons is foolish. Over-reading is somewhat, not that good, as it will bombard your brain with information and believe me, the result of that is, you\u2019ll end up forgetting them quickly, it\u2019s like your brain will vomit all you have read. Try to take everything slowly, like what they say, \u201cSlowly but surely\u201d. Do not ever skip a lesson without understanding it completely, you will only give yourself a headache in your following lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I was done with web development. The next thing I did was learning Python, which I currently use in back-end programming. I learned it from the <a href=\"https://sololearn.com\" target=\"blank\" class=\"w3-text-green w3-hover-text-purple\">SoloLearn</a> app. Its syntax is very nice, the \u201celegant\u201d word fits it well. After weeks, I now know Python, but it\u2019s still not over, in fact, learning programming is eternal, technology evolves each and every time, which you have to cope with. Frameworks come in (especially in JS). The hardest frameworks that I\u2019ve learned in Python was the Django. It is huge, but it\u2019s nice, some hard works will be taken care for you, so you can focus on what really matters a lot. And it has batteries included, it has built-in modules that will make your life easy, but learning it is not easy because like what I\u2019ve said, it is huge, but hey, all pays well at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only Python but Java, C#, Kotlin, VB, C and C++ as well. I learned them because I want to experience coding using them, but I have not developed any fascinating programs using them, except Python and JS, maybe only one in C#, it was a simple \u201calien\u201d game. The good thing in programming is that, once you have mastered the concepts in one programming language, it will be just easy to learn other languages, since almost all languages share the same concepts like OOP, procedures, storages and much more. Python was the first language that taught me OOP, and moving to other languages like Java, was not that hard (but not easy). People think that programming is very hard like a black diamond because they have to learn a lot of languages. But the fact is, you really don\u2019t have to learn all of the programming languages that you hear from other people. All depends on what field you want, like web development, you\u2019ll need pure JS and PHP or Python. Did I say anything about C or C++? Nope. Here\u2019s one as well, try speaking English in China, will you find English as useful? Nope. It\u2019s just picking the needed languages for what situation you are currently dealing with. The same thing with frameworks (these are programs for programmers that make things much easier). Study one framework that you feel comfortable with, once you feel that you\u2019re ready to study others, then go ahead, just don\u2019t learn them all at the same time because it is nonsense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some will say that it is hard, some will not. It sometimes depends on how you quickly understand words and how great your motivation is. Don\u2019t fill up your mind with negative thoughts. The truth is, learning programming is a very long way. But do not get discouraged because everyone can learn to programme, and they can achieve what they want if they give nice effort. <b><i>Programming may hate sometimes, but it is just its other way of telling you that you must not give up on it.</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"w3-opacity w3-small\">Credits to the picture.</p>", "preview_content": "It is, and it is not.

And so I promised to myself that I\u2019ll learn more than just copy and paste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet is one of the most important learning resources. It was 2015 and I was just 14. I taught myself how to program with the aid of our Internet Laboratory in our High School. I was the frequent visitor of our laboratory. Every recess time in our school, I go there and search for different programming languages. I had to choose what programming language that I should learn, and I picked Java. When I was learning Java, I thought Java and JavaScript were all the same, and I wasn\u2019t aware that I was learning JavaScript from W3Schools.com instead of Java. I got very confused that time so I stopped learning to programme. But I still want to learn to programme though. I chose another programming language to learn, and that was Python. I got amazed by its syntax, it\u2019s short and easy to understand, and it has its own interpreter where you can test codes and view documentation when in doubt. Python was the very first language that I learned successfully. After Python, I learned JavaScript, Turbo Pascal, Java, Kotlin, C# and still learning more. Now, my skills in a computer are better than my sisters, and now I have developed 33 programs in Python.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming is a very important process in creating programs. It is fun, but most of the time, it gives a headache, but in that headache, there\u2019s a light full of rewards. Everyone can learn how to program, they just have to do some effort and not quit because those who quit are lazy.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>", "preview_content": "When I was an elementary student, computer for me was just for gaming and adult stuffs.

Did you know that this is where we combine animation, photo designing and editing? And of course, our beloved programming (though it does not love us back sometimes). We might deal a lot with hardware in some situations, like if you want to career developing games in Malls (e.g. Time Zone, Tom\u2019s World, etc.), you have to design the physical form of the game where you will upload the software, the drivers for intricate devices besides from joysticks and monitors. However, game development is not that easy, it is hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like what we all say, there is no easy field, well if you oppose that statement, I guess you\u2019re a professional already. Not to discourage you from liking game development, but the reality is, games just follow with the trend and people\u2019s desires. If they want action games, then they will tend to download and install Cardo-like games. Just like the popular game right now, which is the Mobile Legends. You also have to consider what devices do people mostly use, in this era right now, their worlds go around with their mobile phones, running Android, iOS, or I don\u2019t know, maybe some Windows, to ensure that your game will run anywhere. You must also have targets like whether your game is for children, or for adults. But right now, most games that can be downloaded from the internet can be played by all, they are not gender or age specific. In developing your game, you must create your plan, choose what programming language/s you will use, and what programs that will help you through the process. C# and C++ are the most used languages for game development, but some other languages are used as well, like Python (Disney uses this for their games), JavaScript, and Java. If you\u2019ll choose C#, then you have to go with the Unity game engine. Else if you want to go with C++, you have to choose Unreal. In Python, PyGame is the frequently used library. I don\u2019t know what they use in JavaScript and Java since that I haven\u2019t yet performed game development using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes mastery of a programming language in order to develop games comfortably. Watch videos on the internet about the development of your favourite games to give you motivation, and for you to gather real bits of advice about game development. There are a lot of fields involved with computers, and game development is one of them. Learning this kind of development will cost a lot of time for you to master the concepts, from sprites to communication between scripts. Everything is patience. There is always a long way towards your goal. There is no shortcut to success, well if there is, maybe your success will not be a success at all, it could be just filled with pain and regrets caused by guesses and bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>", "preview_content": "Yes, it really is.

Well, all of our favourite Social Medias have undergone web development. It is the process wherein we build web pages and combine them as a whole, known as a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this process, we encounter databases where we manage our users\u2019 data. We will also meet designing of pages and considering how contents are displayed or viewed. And the most intriguing part is, securing the whole. In web development, there are three languages that must be kept in mind, and they are HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript). These three languages are the very foundation of web development. A web page is a single document and a website is a collection of web pages that are bind together because of their relatedness. The \u201cwebsite\u201d word is not the plural form for web pages, it is just a term for identifying connected web pages. HTML is used for building the pages\u2019 structures, CSS is for styling the pages and JS is for programming them. In dealing with the pages\u2019 structures, you find how different tags work, a page or a document could be a pure HTML or a mix of HTML, CSS and JS. Tags are these codes that are not displayed by the web browser, their major role is to tell the browser how contents must be displayed. HTML is considered to be the easiest language according to most web developers \u2013 those who perform web development. HTML alone will not give you awesome website, that\u2019s why we have CSS for giving our website different designs according to what contents it holds. The real art begins when we are designing our website. We give emotions and feelings that match what messages our pages contain. We choose a colour scheme for attracting our visitors and users. We also use background images to portray more the purpose of our website and to give them positive impressions. In the programming part, we use JS to give our pages' behaviours. How to react to different events triggered by the user or the page itself. What to do with forms, how to purify the data inside it and determine whether it has been properly filled in. JS is known to be the programming language of the web. It follows the functional programming paradigm. When we say functional programming, it means we mostly store the program\u2019s procedures in functions to reduce code repetition, we call these functions if we want to execute their blocks of codes inside of them. Though JS highlights functional behaviour, we can still perform Object Orientation in this language. Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that got its concept from real life objects. We consider the object\u2019s behaviours through methods \u2013 what does the object do or perform, and states known as attributes \u2013 what does the object own besides from methods. What if your website accepts inputs from its users? Of course, you have to manage these inputs, it is either you just process them then forgetting them, or you might choose to store them. When dealing with the data, we recall this term called database, and if we need a database, we will work with a language for managing the database. The very well-known language for dealing with databases is SQL or Sequel. This resembles the English language for retrieving and storing data from and in the database. Web development is divided into two, the front-end and back-end. HTML, CSS and JS work in the front-end. In some situations, JS work in the back-end as well. Like the Node.JS, it is a JS framework that lets you develop JS-powered servers. The back-end part is the hardest because it is where you consider the rest of the works, from handling requests to keeping your database good \u2013 good, like not injected by malicious SQL commands to ruin it. Like what other programmers say \u2013 delete a table from someone\u2019s database and he/she will experience a toothache. If there\u2019s SQL, then what does govern it? The answer is server-side languages, like Python, ASP(dot)NET, Java and much more. But the most used is PHP which originally stood for Personal Homepage but later changed to Hypertext Processor. This programming language handles requests and processes them according to what they want. Ever wondered why the \u201cecho\u201d command is called \u201cecho\u201d? When you shout in a wide area with big and high structures around you, there is an echo, right? Your shout represents the request from the client-side, while the echo represents the response, the part where your shout ends or hits represents the server (take the big and high structure as examples). In every shout, there is an echo. Just like in every request, there is a response. Security starts from the request because it might contain malicious intention for gaining access to the database. Or it could be tons of requests, bombarding your web server and leading it to crash. The responses must only be given to known requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web development is very broad. But don\u2019t get discouraged even if it\u2019s really wide. Patience is the secret to success, not Google \u2013 it\u2019s just one of the conventions. Web developers really earn good money. I had a professional web developer friend once, he does freelancing, and the down payment he gets from each project is never bellowed 50k pesos! What more if he finishes them all? I hope, some of us will become web developers someday, and they can say, \u201cThere is more fun in web development\u201d.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>", "preview_content": "Have you ever wondered how Facebook
